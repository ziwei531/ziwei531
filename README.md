  Hi üëã welcome to my personal GitHub Page üë®‚Äçüíª!
</h1>

## Visit my [portfolio page](https://whoongziwei.vercel.app/)! It's finally live üòÄ.
<p align="center">
  A little back ground about me. 
  
  I am a computer science student in [Taylor's University](https://university.taylors.edu.my/en.html). Aside from the syllabus that all of us CS students typically take in my university, I have taken upon myself   to self-study quite a lot so as to stay relevant with what the industry may be seeking. Historically, I have studied and taken courses that enhanced my data science   skills and also web development skills, which have greatly benefited in me further understanding the fundamentals of programming in general. 

My GitHub portfolio showcases a diverse range of coding projects, including those that I have independently developed and those that were inspired by instructional resources. Technologies that I have worked on are Javascript, HTML & CSS, React, SQL & NoSQL(mongoDB), PHP, Python, Java, and C++.

Oh by the way, if you're a current pursuing CS student from Taylor's, here's my [notes](https://whoongziwei.notion.site/Archived-Bachelor-of-Computer-Science-Subjects-b3e2115178bc48f9827c980c9dfb7f3d) for all the subjects I've taken so far. As they're not exactly very well formatted, hence I'm just gonna give it for free. May they serve you well. 

Here's a link to my [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/u/ziwei531). I occasionally have code snippets posted there for educational purposes (primarily for myself to refer in the future üòÖ) and just a few frontend projects hosted there. I have them pinned if you are interested to see.
