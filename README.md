  Hi 👋 welcome to my personal GitHub Page 👨‍💻!
</h1>

<p align="center">
  A little back ground about me. 
  
  I am a computer science student in Taylor's University. Aside from the syllabus that all of us CS students typically take in my university, I have taken upon myself   to self-study quite a lot so as to stay relevant with what the industry may be seeking. Historically, I have studied and taken courses that enhanced my data science   skills and also web development skills, which have greatly benefited in me further understanding the fundamentals of programming in general. 

</p>

## Notably, these are the achievements that I have earned thus far in my CS journey:
1. [Google Data Analytics Specialization Certification](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/T4TCWZ7G4V4P)
2. [Responsive Web Design by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ziwei/responsive-web-design)
3. [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ziwei/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)
4. [Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-d7aef124-d70f-4538-a3b7-1ad9d5d3d1d4/)

## These are the projects that I have managed to do that are not of my university's assignments. Clicking them will redirect you to the github repository link. 
1. [Next JS Blog](https://github.com/ziwei531/next-blog)
2. [Case Study - How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?](https://github.com/ziwei531/cyclistic-analysis)
3. [Bellabeat Case Study with Python. This leads to the kaggle link instead of a github repository](https://www.kaggle.com/code/whoongziwei/bellabeat-case-study-with-python/notebook)

## These are the note-worthy assignments that I have done, either individually or group.
1. [Object-oriented Programming Finals](https://github.com/ziwei531/OOP-Finals-)
2. [Object-oriented Programming Assignment](https://github.com/ziwei531/oop-assignment-java)

## Why me?
As you can see, I have exerted large amount of efforts to self-study many related programming materials that are not generally not taught in my university. If it isn't obvious yet, this also demonstrate that I am someone who is always knowledge-hungry and who can adapt to new technologies presented to me. If you are looking for a quality intern for your company, please do consider me.
