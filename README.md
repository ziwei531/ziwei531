  Hi 👋 welcome to my personal GitHub Page 👨‍💻!

<p align="center">
  A little back ground about me. 
  
  I am a computer science student in Taylor's University. Aside from the syllabus that all of us CS students typically take in my university, I have taken upon myself   to self-study quite a lot so as to stay relevant with what the industry may be seeking. Historically, I have studied and taken courses that enhanced my data science   skills and also web development skills, which have greatly benefited in me further understanding the fundamentals of programming in general. 

</p>

## Notably, these are the achievements that I have earned thus far in my CS journey:
1. [Google Data Analytics Specialization Certification](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/T4TCWZ7G4V4P)
2. [Responsive Web Design by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ziwei/responsive-web-design)
3. [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ziwei/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)
